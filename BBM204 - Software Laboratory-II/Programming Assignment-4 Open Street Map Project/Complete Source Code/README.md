  Bearmap is a simplified map for Berkeley and it is capable of performing most features you would expect of a mapping 
application. 
  I implement the back end of this application, including map dragging/zooming, map rastering, autocomplete, and finding
shortest path between two locations by A* search algorithm.

__The app link is <a href="http://bearmap-jyp.herokuapp.com">http://bearmap-jyp.herokuapp.com</a>__. (Since Heroku is a free server, the app is a little bit slow right now. You will wait for some seconds before seeing the map) <br>

## How to use : 

Map rastering and zooming <br>
You can scale up and scale down the map by scrolling your mouse <br>

Shortest Path <br>
Double click on the map to select the start point and then double click on the map to select the end point. Then a blue line will appear indicating the shortest path between those two points you select.<br>
